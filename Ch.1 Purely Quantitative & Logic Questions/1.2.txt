My solution was a bit different from the book's but gets the same result.

Instead of imagining the case of 1 and 1000, I imagined 0 and 1000

0 + 1000 equals 1000
So does 1 + 999
So does 2 + 998 and so on

So if n is odd  the sum is n * ( (n // 7 ) + 1)
And if n is even  the sum is n * (n // 7 ) plus n/2
